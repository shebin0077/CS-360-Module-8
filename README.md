The Event Tracking App was designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to manage their schedules by creating, editing, and tracking events. The app was developed with a focus on user-centered design, ensuring that users could seamlessly log in, add personalized event entries, and view their upcoming and past events in an organized grid format. A key feature was the integration of an SMS notification system, allowing users to receive reminders for upcoming events. However, the app was built with flexibility in mind, ensuring that even if a user denied SMS permissions, the core functionalities would remain unaffected. Supporting devices from Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and higher, the app ensures broad accessibility while maintaining compatibility with modern features. The design choices were intentional, following Android and Apple UI guidelines, with a clean and minimalistic UI to enhance usability, accessibility, and navigation. By prioritizing simplicity and functionality, the app successfully provides a reliable scheduling tool for users, reinforcing organization and time management.
The development process followed industry-standard coding practices, incorporating modular development to separate authentication, database management, and UI interactions. SQLite was implemented as the database, ensuring that event data remains persistent even when the app is closed, while Android Studio Layout Editor was used to refine the UI for a polished look. Throughout the process, testing played a crucial role in ensuring that the app functioned correctly, including unit testing, UI testing, database validation, and permission handling. This helped identify and resolve minor issues, such as layout inconsistencies and authentication refinements, ultimately strengthening the appâ€™s performance. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that SMS notifications were integrated effectively while maintaining app stability, which was overcome through graceful degradation techniques. Additionally, optimizing database queries for efficient event management required innovative problem-solving to ensure a smooth user experience. The final product showcases a well-structured authentication system, an intuitive event management UI, and efficient permission handling, demonstrating expertise in mobile application development, UX/UI design, and problem-solving. This project reflects a strong foundation in mobile architecture and serves as a testament to the ability to develop and launch functional, user-friendly applications ready for real-world use.
